Arne's Racing
===========

Arcade racing game written in LUA

This is a version of a classic arcade racing game game written by Arne Schwettmann in LUA, making use of the LÖVE game framework and pixel shaders. It is written for LÖVE 11.5.

Currently, it is only a road and some objects on the side of the road.
Cursor keys to accelerate decelerate and move left/right, z/x creates curves (press keys many times.)

Pre-compiled executables for Windows and OSX are in the bin directory. To compile from source under Windows, simply drag the src directory onto Love.exe version 11.5. For more information on LÖVE, visit love2d.org.
